# A Better Bot

This is yet another trial of me making a discord bot. Do not expect me to put a clean readme file or a professional liscence, as I do not know creating either of them.

## Anyways, you need these installed along with the JavaScript stuff:
- ```Nodemon``` -  _(To autorun the changes made to the file)_
- ```Dotenv``` -  _(For environment variables support)_
- ```Discord.js``` -  _(For obvious reason)_
